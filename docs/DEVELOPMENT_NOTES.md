# 🤖 AI-Driven Development Project

## Project Overview

This entire AML (Anti-Money Laundering) detection platform was developed through **100% prompt-based development** using Claude Code, demonstrating zero manual commits and complete AI-driven software engineering.

## Development Timeline

- **First Commit**: `56ed411` - August 19, 2025 at 13:07:18
- **Latest Commit**: `f3df488` - August 21, 2025 at 18:43:48
- **Total Development Time**: **2 days, 5 hours, 36 minutes**

## Development Methodology

### 🎯 **Zero Manual Coding**
- All code was generated through natural language prompts
- No manual file editing or direct code writing
- Complete reliance on AI for software architecture decisions
- Prompt-driven debugging and issue resolution

### 🔄 **AI-Driven Workflow**
1. **Requirements** → Natural language descriptions
2. **Architecture** → AI-generated system design
3. **Implementation** → Prompt-based code generation
4. **Testing** → AI-driven debugging and validation
5. **Documentation** → Automated documentation generation
6. **Deployment** → AI-guided cloud deployment

### 🛠️ **Technical Achievements**
- **Full-Stack Application**: Flask backend, HTML/CSS/JS frontend
- **Cloud Integration**: Supabase PostgreSQL with SQLite fallback
- **Real-Time Processing**: Live transaction monitoring and alert generation
- **External APIs**: OpenSanctions integration for live sanctions data
- **Production Deployment**: Render.com cloud hosting

### 📊 **Codebase Statistics**
- **Languages**: Python, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, SQL
- **Files Created**: 15+ source files
- **Lines of Code**: 2000+ lines
- **Features Implemented**: 20+ core features
- **API Endpoints**: 10+ REST endpoints

### 🎉 **Key Innovations**
- **Hybrid Database Architecture**: Seamless Supabase-SQLite fallback
- **Real-Time AML Detection**: Live transaction processing with multiple risk rules
- **Dynamic Transaction Generation**: Realistic test data creation
- **Interactive Dashboard**: Real-time visualizations and monitoring
- **Complete Documentation**: Auto-generated README, API docs, and architecture diagrams

## Development Insights

This project demonstrates the potential of AI-driven software development where:
